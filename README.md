# SQL injection attack on today’s technology using mysql database queries\

# Introduction 

The World Wide Web has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. 
Businesses, individuals, and governments have found that web applications 
can offer effective, efficient and reliable solutions to the challenges of 
communicating and conducting commerce in the Twenty-first century.  
However, the security of Web applications has become increasingly important 
in the last decade. With more and more Web-based applications deal with 
sensitive financial and medical data, it is crucial to protect these applications 
from hacker attacks. A security assessment by the Application Defence Centre, 
which included more than 250 Web applications from e-commerce, 
online banking, enterprise collaboration, and supply chain management sites, 
concluded that at least 92% of Web applications are vulnerable to some form 
of attack. 
Much vulnerability in web applications is caused by permitting unchecked 
input to take control of the application, which an attacker will turn to 
unexpected purposes. SQL Injection is the most common type of technique 
used.  
# Beside SQL Injection the other type of attacks are:·  
 Shell injection. 
 Scripting language injection. 
 File inclusion. 
 XML injection. 
 SQL Injection·  
 XPath injection. 
 LDAP injection.  
 SMTP injection
